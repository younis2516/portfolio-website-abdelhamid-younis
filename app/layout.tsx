  description: `Based in üìçVienna. Beside 6 years of experience as a UX/UI designer. Did master studies in HCI at University of Salzburg and took challenging responsibilities early on in my career as a solo product designer in Hotelkit, and Tubics in Austria, which exposed me to unconventional ways to prototyping, minimum viable user testing, low code development, and jumping between a UX design and research role. Beside this I studied engineering for my bachelor, that made me a problem solver by nature. Now working with an awesome team @ REWE International (the biggest retailer in Europe) to design their self-checkout and point-of-sale devices. Beside product design, I am coding since 2 years and now i am working as a part-time frontend developer intern at www.suplyd.com‚Å† `,
